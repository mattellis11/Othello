# Othello

This project is a desktop version of the classic 2-player game Othello. The game is implemented using Java, Swing, and MySQL, and it utilizes the client-server and the MVC design patterns. The client-server pattern is implemented using an open-source framework. Each user runs their own client. Users must log in or create an account when the application starts. A MySQL database stores the usersâ€™ usernames and passwords, and the database and the game logic reside on the server.
